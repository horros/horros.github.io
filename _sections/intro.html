  <h2 class="alt">Hi! I'm Markus Lervik.</h2>
</header>

<p>
  I write code and design application architecture for a living. Have been for the past 20-odd years.
  Currently working at <a href="https://www.jakamo.net">Jakamo</a> doing interesting things with supply
  chains and collaboration, previously spent about 14 years at what was then called Necora Systems.
  I'm a Microsoft certified Cloud Solutions Architect and Developer and what little spare time I have I 
  spend playing guitar and video games.

<p>
  Oh, naturally any and all errors you find on this page are purely my own, and also you shouldn't
  copy-paste anything from my blog into your production servers.
