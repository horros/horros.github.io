  <h2 class="alt">Hi! I'm Markus Lervik.</h2>
</header>

<p>
  I write code and design application architecture for a living. Have been for the past 20-odd years.
  Currently working at <a href="https://www.jakamo.net">Jakamo</a> doing interesting things with supply
  chains and collaboration, previously spent about 14 years before that at what was then called Necora Systems.
  I'm a Microsoft certified Cloud Solutions Architect and what little spare time I have I spend playing
  guitar and video games.
