First post! This is my... I don't know, umpteenth attempt at keeping a blog.
This time it's gonna be different! I hope. I think. I... Strongly believe.

I think my previous attempts failed miserably because I'm always my own worst
critic, and I didn't feel I had anything original or of importance to say or
write about. This time I'm just going to be way easier on myself. I don't do
awesome original groundbreaking computer science research so I don't come up
with spectacular new ideas, but I just may know something or have an angle or
insight someone may possbily find useful.

My second blog post, which'll be published at the same time as this one, is
nothing spectacular at all, just about combining ModSecurity rules to disable
other rules, as there was a bit of a faff before I got it working properly.

And I'm fine with this!

Hope you'll find something useful in this blog in the future, and thank you
for dropping by!
